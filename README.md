Embedding-Augmented Hybrid Retrieval with Quantized Semantic Indexing
Overview

This project studies a hybrid retrieval architecture that integrates lexical search (BM25) with dense semantic embeddings generated by transformer models. We evaluate retrieval quality, storage efficiency, and computational tradeoffs using the MS MARCO passage ranking benchmark.

The work investigates whether embedding-based retrieval can significantly improve ranking effectiveness while remaining storage-efficient through int8 quantization.

Motivation

Traditional search systems rely on inverted indexes and lexical scoring functions such as BM25. While efficient, these methods struggle with vocabulary mismatch and semantic variation.

Recent transformer-based models produce dense vector embeddings that encode semantic meaning. However, dense retrieval introduces architectural concerns including:

Storage overhead

Latency tradeoffs

Integration with lexical systems

Robustness to preprocessing choices

This project evaluates a hybrid retrieval protocol that balances effectiveness and efficiency.

Core Contributions

Empirical validation that dense retrieval significantly outperforms lexical retrieval on MS MARCO (paired statistical testing).

Ablation study on preprocessing robustness (stopwords, normalization).

Latency and storage profiling under float32 and int8 configurations.

Qualitative analysis showing semantic improvements in vocabulary mismatch cases.
